This web page uses the New York Times API to request and retrieve articles.
Created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.

How to use:
* In the search box, enter a keyword for articles of interest
* Be sure to choose how many articles you'd like to pull and click on "search"
* In the "Top Articles" section, the article titles will appear in order of relevance.
* Click on an article title to open up a new tab directed to that article.
* Use "clear results" to clear out the "Top Articles" section

The New York Times API key is free.

In the event that my API key expires, there is a variable within my code which stores the API key.
Its value can be swapped out for an active key.
